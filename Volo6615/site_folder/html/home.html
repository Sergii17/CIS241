<h1>About Me</h1>

Hello, my name is Sergii. I live in Everett for past 4 years. I am going for Web Application and Cloud Developer Associate of Technical Arts Degree. In my free time I like to play soccer and volleyball, these are my two favorites sports. Few years ago, I had classes relative with learning computes.
<p>
I am taking CIS241 for increasing my skills in HTML. Few years ago, I learned some HTML skills. However, I need to refresh my knowledge. This is the first Website which I publish to the Internet. I need to study more to increase my programming skills, and to develop this Website or create more comfortable for using in the future.
</p>
In the future I am going to learn JavaScript, jQuery and PHP in the college. By taking these courses I will refresh and increase my programming skills. Codding websites is fun, so I like to learn this not only at college but also in my free time.
<p>
This website includes 5 pages. You will be able not only to  see my biography but also leave your feedback at the Guestbook page.
